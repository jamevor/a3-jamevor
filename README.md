The goal of this application is for customers to visualize their order. 
From the menu on the left the user can choose a food item and pick it 
what condiment goes on it. 

Getting the textures to load was very difficult along with
getting the modules to work. 

I used JSHINT online linter. Many of the settings enabled 
the application 


Tech Achievement 1: My visualizer loads in multiple images
Tech Achievement 2: I used modules to affect the camera of my visulization

Design Achievement 1: The background of the loader was amde white instead of black becasue users thought white would be more inviting to customers
Design Achievement 2: I followed best practices for accessibility, including providing alt attributes for images and using semantic HTML. There are no <div> or <span> elements in my document.
