The goal of this application is for customers to visualize their order. 
From the menu on the left the user can choose a food item and pick it 
what condiment goes on it. 

Getting the textures to load was very difficult along with
getting the modules to work. 

I used JSHINT online linter. Many of the settings enabled 
the application
